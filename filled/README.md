This folder contains completed iPython notebooks, which will be released at the end of each day.

If you would like to run these, you need to copy them to the main directory: `mv {some_notebook}.ipynb ../`)

`cd ../` to go to the main directory; then run `jupyter notebook` and you should be able to access the completed versions.
