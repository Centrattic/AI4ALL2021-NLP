This folder contains completed iPython notebooks, which will be released at the end of each day. If you would like to run these, you need to copy them to the main directory (i.e. `AI4ALL2018`), overwriting the blank versions or your version of the notebooks that are currently there. Then run `jupyter notebook` and you should be able to access the completed versions of the notebooks.
